# Rust build output and temporary files
# -------------------------------------

# The `target` directory is where Cargo places all compiled binaries,
# intermediate build files, and other artifacts. It should almost
# always be ignored as it can be rebuilt from source.

# These are internal to Cargo's build process and are not needed in version control.
